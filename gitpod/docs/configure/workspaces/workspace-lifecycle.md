# Workspace Lifecycle

Gitpod brings a new way to think about your development environment. Rather than a single local environment that you keep up-to-date, with Gitpod you can have as many [workspaces](/docs/configure/workspaces) as you need.

## Workspace Statuses

The state of the workspace is indicated by the color of the workspace indicator. For example, in the Gitpod [dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces), workspace state is shown on the workspace list.

1. 🟠 **Starting** - Workspace provisioning, inaccessible to the user.
2. 🟢 **Running** - Workspace loaded, accessible to the user.
3. 🟠 **Stopping** - Workspace being stopped, backups performing.
4. 🔴 **Stopped** - Workspace no longer accessible. File system preserved for restart.

> **Important:** Only files in the `/workspace` directory are kept between state transitions.

The following describes each workspace status in detail, including what can cause a workspace to transition from one status to another.

### Workspace Starting

When you open a workspace, it will be in the "starting" state. This means that the workspace is being created and the initialization process is running.

- Where a workspace is being provisioned and initialized.
- If configured and available, a prebuild snapshot is used.
- Otherwise, source control is downloaded into the workspace.

### Workspace Running

- An active workspace is provisioned within Gitpod.
- The workspace can be accessed by the user.

### Workspace Stopped

- No provisioned workspace is running (e.g. ports and URLs are not accessible).
- Only files and directories inside `/workspace` are preserved.
- If the workspace is restarted, the URL is preserved.
- A start is required before the workspace can be used.

### Workspace Deleted

Workspaces are deleted after 14 days. Pinned workspaces are never deleted automatically.

## Workspace Actions

### Workspace Pinning

A pinned workspace is never deleted. You can pin a workspace from your [workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) in the Gitpod dashboard.

### Workspace Snapshotting

You can create a snapshot of a workspace to save its state. This is useful if you want to keep a workspace around for a longer period of time, than the default. Read more about [Snapshots](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration).

## Workspace Deletion

Stopped workspaces are automatically deleted 14 days since the last workspace start. Pinned workspaces are never deleted. You can pin a workspace from your [workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) in the Gitpod dashboard.

## Workspace Timeouts

Running workspaces will stop automatically after a period of inactivity.

### Workspace Inactivity

By default, workspaces stop following 30 minutes without user input (e.g. keystrokes or terminal input commands). You can increase the workspace timeout up to a maximum of 24 hours.

### Editor Disconnect

Currently, all timeouts are dependent on an active editor connection. Closing your Gitpod connected editor or IDE will reduce the workspace timeout to 5 minutes.

### Extending Timeouts

Paying users of Gitpod can extend the timeout of their current workspace using the `gp timeout set` from the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli), which is installed in all gitpod workspaces by default. Extending the workspace timeout does not affect the timeout of other any other workspaces.
