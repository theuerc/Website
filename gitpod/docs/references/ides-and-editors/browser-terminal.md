# Browser Terminal

> The Browser Terminal is currently in [Private Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/17724).

A terminal running in your browser to edit code in your Gitpod workspaces.

Whilst JetBrains IDEs and VS Code both have built-in terminals, using the browser terminal is more minimal and flexible for both full time editing with tools like Vim or for quick edits like running `git` commands on a pull request. Use the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) to access your ports and tasks, and [Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) to customize the experience. Every new tab will open a new shell session.

If you're looking to open a terminal on desktop, see [Command Line (SSH)](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line).

## Managing workspace tasks

If you have defined tasks in your `.gitpod.yml` you can view and access those tasks using the command [`gp tasks`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#tasks). You can see all your running tasks with `gp tasks list` and attach a task with `gp tasks attach` to view its logs. Use `gp tasks` in combination with tools like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), and [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) to achieve a highly customised experience.

> **Note:** Layout configuration such as `openMode` (e.g. `split-right`) are not supported.

## Managing workspace ports

You can also view and manage ports with the command [`gp ports`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#ports). To see open workspace ports, run [`gp ports list`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#ports).

> **Note**: `gp preview` and `gp preview --external` have the same effect with the Browser Terminal, because split-view is not supported in a browser terminal.

## FAQs

### Can I view multiple terminals at the same time? e.g. split windows.

To splitting your terminal into different panes, we recommend `tmux`, which enables tiling your main terminal into multiple ones and much more. See [Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) for instructions on how to install tooling across all of your Gitpod workspaces.

To actually create a new Terminal process, you can simply open a new tab with the same URL. This will create a new terminal process in the same workspace.

See: [A beginner's guide to tmux | Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/introduction-tmux-linux) for more.

### Can I use different shells?

Yes, you can use different shells. The default shell is `bash`, but you can change it in your [Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles).

### What tools are available?

The set of tools available will depend on the tools that are included in your [Workspace image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) and the tools that you install through your [Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles).
